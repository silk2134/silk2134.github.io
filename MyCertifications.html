  I have completed two certifications through CompTIA so far.
  The first is Security+ which demonstrates the knowledge and skills required
  to assess the security posture of an enterprise environment and recommend and
  implement appropriate security solutions; monitor and secure hybrid environments,
  including cloud, mobile, and IoT; operate with an awareness of applicable laws and
  policies, including principles of governance, risk, and compliance; identify, analyze,
  and respond to security events and incidents.
  </p>

  The second is the A+. This exam comprises of two separate parts, both of which must
  be passed in order to become certified. The first exam,CompTIA A+ 220-1101,
  covered: mobile devices, networking technology, hardware, virtualization and cloud computing.
  The second part of the exam, CompTIA A+ 220-1102 covered: operating systems,
  security, software and operational procedures.

  I have also received two certifcations from Evolve Security Academy.
  The first certificate shows my understanding of technical cybersecurity concepts
  including: networking, scripting, vulnerability assessments, SecOps architecture,
  cloud security, social engineering, threat hunting, threat intelligence,
  and incident detection and response.
  I have also demonstrated technical competency of tools including Nmap, Wireshark,
  BurpSuite, Kali Linux, Metasploit, Nessus, OSINT, Splunk, AWS security
  and practical competency by completing a cybersecurity apprenticeship with a capstone
  Not-For-Profit Vulnerability Assessment with report and presentation to the client.

  The second shows knowledge in hands-on labs with an intermediate understanding of
  technical cybersecurity tools through technical competency in network traffic, web application assessment,
  network architecture, cloud security and scripting by passing a 5-hour written exam and a 24-hour lab exam.

  Another certificate I earned was for the Splunk Fundamentals course. It taught all
  of the basics for Splunk including: components, data ingestion, basic searches,
  using the search field, best practices, the Splunk Search Language, various commands,
  creating reports and dashboards, and creating lookups and scheduled reports and alerts.
