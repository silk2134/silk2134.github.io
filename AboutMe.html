      Hi, my name is Scott Krager. I am really excited that you found my page.
      I'm not formerly trained as a coder or developer but took it upon myself to learn.
      The process has been really fun using HTML and CSS to create a professional page.
      I used my reasoning and problem solving to think about changes and troubleshoot
      issues that came up along the way.

    <p>
      Professionally, I am transitioning into cybersecurity and have loved learning a ton of tools and
      processes within the industry. This page highlights some of what I have done but does
      not highlight my ability to retain the information. I have a great passion for learning
      and have prided myself on committing all studies to memory.
      <br />

    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I am married to my supportive wife, Lauren, and together have
      three children: a daughter, Evie, and twins, Juliette and Smith. I am originally
      from Indiana and have resided in Illinois for the last 8 years.
